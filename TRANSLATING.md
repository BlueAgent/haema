# Translating

Thanks for wanting to translate Haema! Here are some notes to provide context for translating certain things.

## Mod Name

 - 'Haema' should always be 'Haema'.

## Items/Blocks

 - The Vampire Blood Injector is a syringe.
 - The Righteous Banner is the vampire hunter equivalent of the Ominous Banner.
 - The Ritual Altar is a multiblock structure. There is a Basic and Blackstone variant. The block in the centre of it is called the Ritual Table. Feel free to change these terms around to whatever sounds better, as long as they're self-consistent within your language.
 - In `item.haema.vampire_blood_injector.desc`, 'Strength' refers to the Strength effect, so use a similar word to that used by Minecraft to translate Strength.
 - In `item.haema.empty_vampire_blood_injector.desc`, 'Weak' refers to the Weakness effect, so use a similar word to that used by Minecraft to translate Weakness.

## Entities

 - The Vampirager is a Vampire Illager.

## Effects

 - Sunlight sickness is a *bad* sickness. You will die from it.

## Abilities

 - The vampire dash may not translate cleanly while still keeping the implication of a short teleport - translations have turned it into 'shadow step' or equivalents. Do whatever sounds good!

## Powers

 - The `power.haema.` translation keys are [Origins](https://github.com/Apace100/Origins) powers.

## Book of Blood

 - The book of blood is currently being rewritten - it's probably a waste of time to translate it as it is (though I appreciate it if you do! I don't know how long it'll stay in it's current form for)

## GUI

 - The `gui.haema.hud` translation keys show up on-screen during gameplay, so should be short and concise.
 - The `gui.haema.message` translation keys show up on-screen on the action bar, so should be short enough to be readable there.

## Advancements

 - Translate advancements however you like - feel free to fully rewrite them! With that in mind, here's some context for the english names:
   - `create_ritual_table` - original name
   - `drink_blood` - original name
   - `drink_good_blood` - original name
   - `drink_player_blood` - reference to [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jCpPsWQZEY)
   - `fail_conversion` - reference to [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhMdujZeEY)
   - `fulfil_contract` - reference to [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjZ0dNCHR5U)
   - `get_blood` - reference to [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX3Gw82f6GU)
   - `get_contract` - original name
   - `kill_vampire_hunter` - original name
   - `root` - Book of Blood in Ancient Greek, probably best not to translate this one.
   - `store_blood` - original name
   - `trigger_vampire_hunters` - reference to [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jCpPsWQZEY)
   - `use_blood` - reference to [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45WUhsq4d0I)
   - `use_dash` - original name
   - `use_invis` - common en_us saying
   - `use_ritual_table` - original name
   - `use_mist` - a [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-fog-is-coming)
 - The 'original names' are probably safer to have a literal translation. The song references might be best to make up a new name.
